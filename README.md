#ATM Interface Program

This Python program simulates a simple ATM interface, allowing users to create and manage bank accounts, make deposits, withdraw funds, check balances, and view a mini statement of recent transactions. This is a fully functional ATM simulation with authentication, balance management, and transaction tracking.
